# [Exploration](readme.md) - [mimir](https://github.com/Huginn18/mimir)
This log was started after project started, to be precise after first prototype.


## 19/02/2021
I was experimenting with `emacs` for few days. Trying to set it up for my needs tested my sanity to the breaking point. So after spending 4 days in `init.el` I decided to go back to work on `mimir`, even thinking about doing vim plugin for it.

### So what are the goals?
- quick note taking
- log/journal system
- project management
	- TODOs
	- project Documentation
	- project Estimation
- CV Generator

#### Quicknote taking
`QN` files will be by default stored in `~/config/.mimir.d/quicknote`. `Quick Note` module allows create, edit, delete and search for notes.

#### Log/Journal
`log` handles main log directory and also can handle logs for separate projects. Said that log's commands would be creating/updating logs and search them.

#### Project Management
For quite some time recently I got annoyed with lack of proper tool that I needed to do project management, namely making estimations, todo/kanban and doing documentation. Probably there are some other features I will add along the way but for now this is the list.

#### CV Generator
Creating and sending CV was always a chore for me, so why not use yaml or json and generate nice pdf from it? I need to figure it out later.
